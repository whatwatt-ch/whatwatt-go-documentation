- **When to use**: Initial setup of secure MQTT infrastructure, preparing broker environment for whatwatt Go integration, development environment setup
- **Prerequisites**: Ubuntu/Debian Linux system with sudo privileges, basic Linux package management knowledge, systemd service management
- **Related to**: TLS certificate generation, broker configuration, secure MQTT client testing, service verification
- **Validates against**: Mosquitto 2.0.21+ installation with verified service status and client tool availability

## Key Facts

- **Package requirements**: mosquitto, mosquitto-clients, openssl packages
- **Installation method**: APT package manager on Ubuntu/Debian systems

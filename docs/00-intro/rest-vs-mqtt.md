# REST vs MQTT

## Document Context

- **Purpose**: Comparison guide for choosing between REST API and MQTT integration methods based on use case requirements and architectural needs
- **When to use**: Architecture planning phase, integration design decisions, protocol selection for smart meter projects, technical evaluation
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of HTTP/REST concepts, MQTT publish-subscribe messaging, integration patterns, network protocols
- **Related to**: First request (first-request.md), MQTT overview (30-mqtt/index.md), REST polling (20-rest/polling.md), streaming (20-rest/streaming.md)
- **Validates against**: WhatWatt Go dual-protocol support, real-world integration patterns, performance characteristics

## Key Facts

- **REST API**: HTTP-based request-response for on-demand reads, configuration, CRUD operations
- **MQTT**: Lightweight publish-subscribe for streaming telemetry, real-time monitoring, event-driven automation
- **Use cases**: REST for polling/configuration, MQTT for continuous data streams and low-latency applications
- **Network efficiency**: MQTT optimized for bandwidth and reliability, REST better for simple integrations
- **Integration complexity**: REST simpler to implement, MQTT requires broker infrastructure

## Local REST API over HTTP

The REST API provides a straightforward method for integrating the WhatWatt Go device through standard web protocols. Key advantages include:

- Ease of integration with various systems due to its simplicity and compatibility with many development environments
- Allows for direct implementation of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data provided by the device

## MQTT Client Connection

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol. It is particularly beneficial for scenarios where bandwidth usage and network reliability are significant concerns. By connecting as an MQTT client, the WhatWatt Go device can:

- Efficiently handle high volumes of data transmission with minimal overhead
- Ensure low latency, making it ideal for real-time monitoring and control applications
- Optimize the use of network resources, providing a reliable method for data communication

## When to Use Which

- Use **REST** for on-demand reads and configuration
- Use **MQTT** for streaming telemetry and event-driven automation

# Restart

## Document Context

- **Purpose**: Remote device reboot API endpoint for troubleshooting and maintenance operations via REST API
- **When to use**: Troubleshooting connectivity issues, recovery from unresponsive state, testing system reliability
- **Prerequisites**: Administrative access, understanding that reboot interrupts data collection, rare necessity in normal operation
- **Related to**: System information (system-info.md), firmware updates (firmware-update.md), factory reset (factory-reset.md)
- **Validates against**: Device uptime capabilities (months of operation), 30-60 second reboot cycle timing

## Key Facts

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/reboot` - Triggers immediate device restart
- **Method**: POST - Returns 204 No Content on success, connection lost during reboot
- **Downtime**: 30-60 seconds typical reboot cycle with data collection interruption
- **Auto-restart**: Device never self-reboots except after firmware updates
- **Usage**: Rarely needed due to dynamic configuration and robust operation

!!! info "Do you need to reboot?"
    Configuration changes apply dynamically without a reboot. The device is designed for long uninterrupted operation (months of uptime). The only routine case that triggers a reboot is a successful firmware upgrade.

!!! tip "No automatic restarts"
    The device never restarts itself during normal operation. If you see a reboot, it was explicitly requested by an API call/WebUI action or triggered at the end of a firmware update.

!!! note "Alternative Method"
    Device restart can also be performed from the device's WebUI.

!!! warning "Connection Loss"
    A reboot temporarily interrupts data collection and connectivity (typically ~30â€“60 seconds). To ensure uninterrupted logging, avoid rebooting unless strictly necessary.

## Endpoint Details

This endpoint allows you to reboot the device remotely. In normal operation you should not need to use it.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|

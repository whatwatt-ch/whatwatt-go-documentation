Welcome to the comprehensive API documentation for **whatwatt Go** - the Swiss Smart Meter integration device.

## What is whatwatt Go?

whatwatt Go is a cutting-edge device that connects to any Swiss Smart Meter, enabling real-time energy consumption monitoring and data access through REST API and MQTT protocols. Made for Switzerland and Europe, it empowers users to optimize their energy consumption through instant, real-time data access.

## Key Features

- 🔌 **Universal Compatibility**: Works with all current Smart Meters from major manufacturers (Ensor, Iskraemeco, Kamstrup, Landis+Gyr, Sagemcom, Semax, NES, and Meter+Control)
- ⚡ **Real-Time Data**: Instant access to energy consumption data
- 🌐 **Multiple Protocols**: REST API and MQTT support
- 🔐 **Secure Communication**: TLS/SSL encryption support
- 📊 **Rich Data Format**: JSON responses with detailed meter information
- 🏠 **Local Control**: Your data stays with you - no cloud dependency

## Quick Start

Choose your integration method:

=== "REST API"

    Perfect for web applications and simple polling scenarios.

    ```bash
    # Get current meter reading
    curl http://192.168.1.100/api/v1/report

    # Get system information
    curl http://192.168.1.100/api/v1/system
    ```

    **[→ REST API Guide](20-rest/polling.md)**

=== "MQTT"

    Ideal for real-time applications and IoT integration.

    ```bash
    # Subscribe on YOUR MQTT BROKER to the topic you configured in Device Settings → MQTT (publish.topic)
    # Example: broker on localhost, topic prefix 'lab/energy/'
    mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -t "lab/energy/#" -v

    # If your broker requires username/password authentication
    # mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -u USER -P PASS -t "lab/energy/#" -v
    ```

    **[→ MQTT Guide](30-mqtt/index.md)**

=== "Secure MQTT"

    Enterprise-grade security with TLS encryption.

    ```bash
    # Connect to YOUR MQTT BROKER with TLS (mutual TLS optional)
    mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8883 -v \
      --cafile ca.crt --cert client.crt --key client.key \
      -t "lab/energy/#"
    ```

## Energy Transition

> The Energy Transition will only succeed if we can optimize our own energy consumption. This is only possible if we know our consumption in real time and can react accordingly.

The Swiss Federal Regulation concerning electricity supply stipulates that Smart Meters must be equipped with an interface that allows retrieving measured data in real time. **whatwatt Go uses this interface to give you control over your energy data.**

## Data Ownership

**Who owns your energy consumption data?** The consumption data collected from your household belongs to **you**. You decide with whom you would like to share this data. whatwatt Go ensures your data stays local and under your control.
